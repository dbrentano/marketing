      <h1>About Sonny Side</h1>
      <p>We’re a creative growth studio focused on helping brands connect creativity with performance. Our work blends

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Sonny Side was founded by Marissa Notaro, a digital marketer with roots in the cybersecurity industry. Her
        experience
        working with technology companies gave her a deep understanding of how modern brands grow, adapt, and
        communicate in
        complex markets. After seeing how often marketing missed the connection between creative storytelling and
        data-driven
        strategy, she set out to build a studio that could bridge that gap.</p><br>
      <p>Named after her dog Sonny, the company embodies optimism, clarity, and focus. Today, Sonny Side helps
        businesses in and
        beyond the tech world use digital marketing and analytics to strengthen their message, reach the right
        audiences, and
        create measurable growth.</p>
